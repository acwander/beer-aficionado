# Project Description

This is a simple website for beer enthusiasts with functionality throughout each section including: a sticky nav, auto changing banner images, toggling display of how it's made information, and a carousel. As the user clicks next or previous buttons surrounding the carousel, it will display the respective image, name, style, alcohol content, and description.

# More Ideas

- Search feature to allow users to search beers by name or style and display the results.
- Get Breweries from BreweryDB and allow users to select a location to display breweries in the area.

# Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- [Brewery DB](https://www.brewerydb.com/)

# Issues and Resolutions

## Roadblocks

- Getting a CORS error on API pull. I had to send my get request through a proxy found in this [article](https://medium.com/@dtkatz/3-ways-to-fix-the-cors-error-and-how-access-control-allow-origin-works-d97d55946d9).
- Limited information available using the free version of BreweryDB.

## Wins

- Found a way for the GET request to work correctly with the scope of the project.
