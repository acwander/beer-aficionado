          <h2>How Beer is Made</h2>
          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <p>
            Beer is made from four basic ingredients: Barley, water, hops and
            yeast. The basic idea is to extract the sugars from grains (usually
            barley) so that the yeast can turn it into alcohol and CO2, creating
            beer.
          </p>
          <h3>Malting</h3>
          <p>
            The brewing process starts with grains, usually barley (although
            sometimes wheat, rye or other such things.) The grains are harvested
            and processed through a process of heating, drying out and cracking.
            The main goal of malting is to isolate the enzymes needed for
            brewing so that it’s ready for the next step.
          </p>
          <h3>Mashing</h3>
          <p>
            The grains then go through a process known as mashing, in which they
            are steeped in hot, but not boiling, water for about an hour. This
            activates enzymes in the grains that cause it to break down and
            release its sugars. Once this is done you drain the water from the
            mash which is now full of sugar from the grains. This sticky, sweet
            liquid is called wort. It’s basically unmade beer, sort of like how
            dough is unmade bread.
          </p>
          <h3>Boiling</h3>
          <p>
            The wort is boiled for about an hour while hops and other spices are
            added several times.
          </p>
          <p>
            What are hops? They are the small, green cone-like fruit of a vine
            plant. Hops provide bitterness to balance out all the sugar in the
            wort and provide flavor. They also act as a natural preservative.
          </p>
          <h3>Fermentation</h3>
          <p>
            Once the hour long boil is over the wort is cooled, strained and
            filtered. It’s then put in a fermenting vessel and yeast is added to
            it. At this point the brewing is complete and the fermentation
            begins. The beer is stored for a couple of weeks at room temperature
            (in the case of ales) or many many weeks at cold temperatures (in
            the case of lagers) while the yeast works its magic. The yeast eats
            up all that sugar in the wort and spits out CO2 and alcohol as waste
            products.
          </p>
          <h3>Bottling & Aging</h3>
          <p>
            You’ve now got alcoholic beer, however it is flat and un-carbonated.
            The flat beer is bottled, at which time it is either artificially
            carbonated like a soda, or if it’s going to be ‘bottle conditioned’
            it’s allowed to naturally carbonate via the CO2 the yeast produces.
            After allowing it to age for anywhere from a few weeks to a few
            months, the beer is ready to drink!
